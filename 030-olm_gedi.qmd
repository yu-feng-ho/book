# OpenLandMap GEDI Official Documentation

## General Description

Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) is a full-waveform satellite LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging), collecting 3D measurements over land (trough recorded backscattered laser energy, i.e., waveforms) near-globally, between 51.6° N and S within a laser footprint diameter of 25 m between 2019-03-25 onward. To foster the uptake and mask out the complexity and large data volume of GEDI products (GEDI L2, version 2,- V002) to the OEMC  and broader users, we aim to host pre-filtered and high-quality GEDI points (including their relTechnical Documentationative heights, and waveform- and derived-attributes) and offer them as a cloud service.

The data is organized in Parquet Dataset and the visualization of data is in [OpenLandMap STAC](http://stac.openlandmap.org/GEDI02/collection.json), 3336 partitions in 5 degree by 5 degree by year (*Fig. 1*).

## Technical Specification

### (Geo)Parquet

Apache Parquet is an open source column-oriented data format designed for efficient data storage and retrieval. Parquet has two features among other cloud-native formats (e.g. flatgeobuf, PMTiles) . Firstly, it provides data compression that increases I/O approximately 10 times than other formats like flatgeobuf, geopackage, and shapefile (Chris Holmes et al., 2023). Secondly, it supports file partition. Apache Parquet allows writing rows in a partition, grouped by one to multiple columns. Furthermore, if the writing follows the same partition structure, it can keep appending to a single parquet dataset.

### Data Pre-filtering and fusion

In the pre-filtering, we **excluded** low-quality GEDI points, i.e., GEDI shots with **Quality Flag equal to 0**, **Degradation Flag larger than 0,** or **Sensitivity smaller than 0.95**.

In the fusion, **we selected attributes from L2A and L2B products respectively and joined them into a single product l2.v002.gedi**. Those selected attributes are listed at the table: [Column Information of OpenLandMap GEDI Level 2](032-olm_column_table.html)

The processes are committed and pushed to OpenLanMap GitHub (<https://github.com/openlandmap/spatial-layers/tree/main/input_layers/GEDI_L2A>). If you discover a bug, artifact, or inconsistency, or if you have a question please through the following channel.
